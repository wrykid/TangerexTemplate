Tangerex Template.
This can be used to replace the down replit of tangerex template.

Its very easy to replace!

Just replace: local tangerex = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://something.id.repl.co/Tangerex/Template/main.lua"))() with    loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrykid/TangerexTemplate/main/TGXTemplate.lua"))()

and thats it!
